**Lost Wright Brothers' 'Flying Machine' Patent Resurfaces**
============================================================

By Mindy Weisberger, Senior Writer

Wright patent submitted 3/23/1903

First Flight Dec. 17, 1903

Patent granted 5/22/1906

In 1978 NA lent the patent with pictures to the Smithsonian Air and
Space.

Archivists noted the patent was returned 1980, but it was unable to be
found later, so it was added to the missing historical documents and
files list.

National archives have over 269 million pages in storage. Not hard to
misplace things.

Patent filed in the wrong spot and an Archival recovery program tracked
it down after a targeted search.

Patent will be exhibited starting May 20, 2016 to commemorate the 110th
anniversary of receiving the patent.

The purpose of an archives is to preserve artefacts and documents deemed
important (definition of archives).

So what do we do whenever things are stolen from the archives or are
misplaced. They’re unable to preserve, and they’re in a sense failing at
their job (word this different)

Is the NARA overwhelmed? Should they be turning down or deaccessioning
items that are in their possession.

How do you manage so many materials?

American Heritage Center example from class. Too many things to protect
and preserve.
